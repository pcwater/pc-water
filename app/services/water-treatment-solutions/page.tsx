    question: 'What does water treatment infrastructure delivery include?',
    answer:
      'Our water treatment scope covers the full treatment chain — raw water intake, chemical conditioning, coagulation and filtration, UV and chlorine disinfection, SCADA and automation integration, and the civil and mechanical interfaces needed for reliable day-to-day operation. We coordinate all components from design through to commissioning and handover.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work on partial upgrades or only new treatment plants?',
    answer:
      'Both. We deliver new treatment facilities and modular upgrades to existing plants. If only part of your treatment train needs replacing or expanding — for example, adding UV disinfection to an existing chlorine system, or upgrading SCADA controls — we can scope and deliver that component independently.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is water treatment delivery suitable for remote and regional communities?',
    answer:
      'Yes, and it is one of our strongest areas. Remote communities often have the most acute treatment needs and the fewest local contractors capable of delivering to standard. We deploy FIFO crews, manage remote logistics, and bring the same engineering rigour to difficult-access sites as we do to urban projects.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What standards apply to potable water treatment systems?',
    answer:
      'Potable water treatment must conform to the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG) administered by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). Project-specific compliance is also shaped by state regulations, asset owner requirements, and operating context. Our engineers design and document to meet these obligations at every stage.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you handle the full project scope or just the treatment components?',
    answer:
      'We can manage the full scope or integrate as the treatment-specific subcontractor within a larger civil or infrastructure program. We hold RPEQ engineering certification and provide all required documentation — design certificates, as-built drawings, commissioning records, and operational handover packs.',

                PC Water Infrastructure is positioned as more than a storage provider. This service
                covers the treatment side of the asset journey as well: the infrastructure, process
                interfaces, and delivery coordination needed to move water safely from intake through
                treatment and into dependable supply.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                It is suited to councils, remote communities, industrial operators, and programs where
                treatment performance, operational continuity, and standards-led delivery all matter.
